I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.

* This week for module 9 we continued mastering our WordPress skills along with group work for the upcoming drafts. We discussed how to give beneficial and effective feedback on our peer's work.

I can describe and compare content management systems.

* This week we continued to use WordPress to edit and publish our posts. I also worked in Hugo to add additional posts to my website. I am able to differentiate what CMS would be the most effective to use given the circumstance and situation.

I can manage content using established workflows.

*  This week my group established new roles for each member in order to complete the blog post assignment. Our communication through Microsoft teams helped our group establish a solid workflow. Being able to directly message other group members about changes and fixes to the post was successful.

I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.

* I utilized the themes on WordPress to improve the looks of my content. For this week's blog post I was in charge of writing the blog and gathering all the additional pieces of content.

I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.

* I learned about new resources that better explain what WordPress is capable of. Wordpress.org also has many helpful forums that cover all aspects of WordPress features. I am able to view older modules in Canvas to review the information and certain topics.
