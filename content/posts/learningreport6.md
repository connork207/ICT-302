I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.

* This week for module 6 we looked at how our Hugo skills can be transferred over to WordPress to help us understand content mangenment better.

I can describe and compare content management systems.

* This week we explored the unique tools WordPress has to over and I consider it superior to using Hugo. WordPress is far more easier to conceptualize and understand based off the simple layout and organization of content.

I can manage content using established workflows.

*  This week my group used the roles we established last week to complete our first blog post assignment. Our communication through Microsoft teams helped our group establish a solid workflow.

I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.

* I utilized the themes on WordPress to improve the looks of my content. I also learned how to link images to blog posts on WordPress.

I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.

* I learned about new resources that better explain what WordPress is capable of. An example of one of these resources is the subreddit r/WordPress.
