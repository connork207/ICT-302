I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.

* This week for module 8 we looked at different CMS and where they would come in use. We discussed choosing the right CMS and the traits/features that should go along with it.

I can describe and compare content management systems.

* This week we continued to use the tools WordPress has to over. I also worked with my group to develop an immersive blog post with interesting content.

I can manage content using established workflows.

*  This week my group established new roles for each member in order to complete our third blog post assignment. Our communication through Microsoft teams helped our group establish a solid workflow. Being able to directly message other group members about changes and fixes to the post was successful.

I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.

* I utilized the themes on WordPress to improve the looks of my content. I was the developer for this weeks blog post, so I was in charge of formatting the blog post and adding HTML elements. 

I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.

* I learned about new resources that better explain what WordPress is capable of. An example of one of these resources is the subreddit r/WordPress. Wordpress.org also has many helpful forums that cover all aspects of WordPress features.
