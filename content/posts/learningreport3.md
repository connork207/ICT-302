This learning module I learned about more tools that can help me organize task and improve my productivity and workflow. Using Micosoft teams I can assign different tasks for myself to complete and my group members. I understand the importance of the five different roles that help manage content workflows. I can apply CSS templates to diversify my content style and improve my design.
