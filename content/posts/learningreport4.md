I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.

* This week for module 4 we defined how technology stack and bi-directional publishing works along with exploring different content management systems.

* We looked into how different systems can be used based off of the consumerâ€™s needs, style, and desired output.

I can manage content using established workflows.

*  This week we discussed how established workflows are an important part of managing content and will be utilized in the group project soon.

I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.

* This week I continued to develop new skills operating github and Hugo. This includes markdown elements and headings to blog posts.

I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
