I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.

* This week for module 12 we discussed how plug-in and extensions can be added to a CMS to add new features and functions that were not before available in the standalone product. A CMS's extensibility model can be described as the collection of processes, services, tools, and APIs that can be used to extend the functions of a CMS. It is important to differentiate secure and reputable plug-ins from outdated and shaky ones on an open-source platform. 

I can describe and compare content management systems.

* This week we discovered new plug-ins and extensions that can be used with WordPress and Hugo to enhance content. I used Hugo this week to update my personal blog. I am able to differentiate what CMS would be the most effective to use given the circumstance and situation. I also understand open-source CMS's have more access to additional extensions and plug-ins.

I can manage content using established workflows.

*  This week my group established new roles for each member in order to complete the blog post assignment. At this point in the semester, our group is very diligent in completing tasks and minimal questions are asked considering we have created blog posts in the prior weeks. In Microsoft Teams our group discusses who has what role and due dates as to when the post will be written, edited, and posted. We have remained very consistent with this method of completing the blog post which has been a success. Our group is comfortable making edits and changes to each other's work to improve the final result. We began working on upcoming walk-through assignments as well as discussing different methods and ideas for ICT related topics.

I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.

* I explored the different themes and extensions that can be added to WordPress to improve the looks of my content. For this week's blog post I was in charge of writing the blog post. I understand how to diversify the looks and functions of a website with the tools provided on Hugo and WordPress.

I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.

* I learned about the developer tools page on Hugo as well as how to find third-party plug-ins for WordPress. Reddit.com/r/Wordpress/ has a variety of pages that discuss updates to prominent plug-ins and new software.
