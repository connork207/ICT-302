This learning module I learned what the true definition of content was and how content can be optimized for humans to view. I was able to manage the content I provided on my Hugo page through my GitHub repository. This module showed me new resources I can use for self-directed learning such as https://www.w3schools.com/. I am starting to understand how pieces of content are organized on a blog website.
