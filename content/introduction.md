Hello everyone my name is Connor and I am from Illinois. My hobbies include:

1. Playing and watching sports
2. Listening to podcasts
3. Reading

I am majoring in ICT with a focus on databases and cybersecurity at the moment. I enjoy rock music from the 70s and 80s along with 90s and current rap. I look forward to learning more about ICTs and how we use them in the future.
